# Icon-Experience
A simple game in which tasks are randomly generated and users must pick the correct icon to proceed. A catalyst for experimenting with the psychology of choices

This work was carried out with a small team from Bournemouth University and EPFL+ECAL Lab which combines both Psychology and Gaming

Unity 5+ is required to edit this project as there are many factors which are open to change

You may change which tasks that the user can carry out, the images of the icons themselves and whether or not you require a custom task/icon name when running an experiment within the editor itself and any extra changes need to be scripted 

This may be deployed to desktops (Windows confirmed) however will need to be modified in order for it to be mobile friendly

Thanks and enjoy this code full of arrays and lists!
